For that apply hydrating leave in conditioner followed by 2/3 drops of oil daily on hair length. Wear braids or buns more. Protect your hair by wearing silk braid cover or silk bonnet.";

  export const dandruffCare = "Dandruff is a skin disease. Wash your hair with ketoconazol shampoo for once/twice. After getting rid of dandruff fully, switch to normal shampoo. Add 4-5 drops of tea tree essential oil in your oil blends regularly for preventing dandruff.";

Start by applying little amount of leave-in-conditioner on your wet hair thoroughly. Next take some styling gel and apply it on hair lengths using praying hand. Scrunch your hair and diffuse/air dry it. Once dried, you may see some cast around your hair. Take two drops of oil and scrunch hair again.';

  export const splitEnds_breakage_Care = "Split ends and hair breakage, canâ€™t be cured but prevented. First start with trimming the damaged/splitted parts of hair. Apply leave-in-conditioner & 2-3 drops of Almond/Argan/Jojoba oil daily on your ends. Use silk pillowcases. Always wear braids or other protective hairstyles while sleeping. If comfortable, wear a silk braid protector/silk bonnet while sleeping. Never rub wet hair & brush hair aggressively. Try wearing protective hairstyles a lot.

Lastly, always be gentle and protective about hair."

  export const highElasticityCare = "As you mentioned, your hair has high elascity (it stretches too much before breaking), It means your hair lacks protein. Protein based hair masks will be the most effective thing to balance moisture. Try to apply a protein based mask (curd mask/rice water) twice per month. Add protein in your diet too. Be cautious about protein overload as that can damage hair more."

  export const lowPorousThinHair = 'Low porous hair means your hair cuticles are not much open. Coconut oil is well known as magic oil. But it has heavy molecules which makes it harder to penetrate in your hair cuticle. So for low porous & thin hair, preferred oils are lightweight oil like Almond, Argan, Olive, Grapeseed oil, pumpkin seed oil etc. You can mix few drops of rosemary essential with lightweight oils for growth boost. In general, Avoid coconut & castor oil. Use lightweight oils with few drops of essential oils for best result. Also always use warm oil. If possible use a heatcap for better absorption of oils after oiling.'

  export const notLowPorous = 'Apply coconut oil or castor oil with some carrier oil like almond/argan/olive oil once a week at least to maintain hair health. For growth booster, add few drops of rosemary essential oil. You can use any carrier and essential oil. But always be cautious about the consistency of oil. Do not apply heavy oil directly without dialuting in carrier oils because that causes more damage than good.';

  export const lowElasticityCare = "As you mentioned, your hair has low elascity (it breaks instantly), It means your hair lacks moisture. Hydrating hair masks will be the most effective thing to balance moisture. Try to apply a hydration mask (Aloevera/flaxseed gel) once per week. Apply hydrating leave-in conditioners everday on hair lengths. Last but not the least, keep yourself hydrated, drink adequate water everyday!";

  export const greyingAdvice = "Hair turns out grey when follicles die. There's no way to make a grey hair black again. But with proper care, we can delay greying. First need to make sure that vitamin B12, vit D & protein intakes are enough. Don't forget about massaging scalp at all. The more you massage, The more oxygen reaches to hair follicles. Which prevents it from dying. Next you should apply Amla & Bhringraj infused curd mask on scalp twice a month. Amla & Bhringraj infused oil is also a good choice. Living stress-free life with healthy diet and caring hair will help in delaying hair greying!";

  export const baldness = "Bald patches or baldness is a common hair issue nowadays. This means your hair follicles are dead totally. So you need to revive them. Micro needling followed by hair growth booster serum application will help in reviving hair. So you may use a 0.5mm micro needle once a week & rosemary water everyday. Consistency is key. Hairgrowth takes time & patience. If you religiously follow these, you can see growth in 2~6 months.";
